Something was wierd with the flyttjpg.sh script. For some reason it would not run on my system, it just returned: 'Syntax error: end of file unexpected (expecting "fi")'.
I got it to run once, but then (without changing anythin) it would not run again.

No matter, the problem with the rydd.sh script is that it will scan the 'jpg' folder for .jpg files, and then put them in a subfolder called 'jpg'.
After multiple runs, This would result in there being a lot of 'jpg' subfolders in the 'jpg' folder.

I fixed this proplem by altering the find command in rydd.sh. The command now excludes any folders named 'jpg'.
The new script is called 'newRydd.sh'
